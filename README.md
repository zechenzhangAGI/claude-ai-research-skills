## Our Mission

**Enable AI agents to autonomously conduct AI research**—from hypothesis to experimental verification. We provide the foundational skills that empower **AI research agents** to conduct experiments, including preparing datasets, executing training pipelines, deploying models, and validating scientific hypotheses.

## Path Towards AI Research Agent

**Problem**: Conducting AI research requires mastering 100+ frameworks and tools. Experimentation is slow, error-prone, and requires deep expertise in each component of the stack.

**Solution**: Provide AI agents with comprehensive, battle-tested skills for every stage of AI research—enabling autonomous hypothesis testing through systematic experimentation.

**Impact**:
- 🔬 **Hypothesis-Driven Research** - Agents design and execute experiments to test scientific ideas
- ⚡ **Automated Experimentation** - From data processing to model deployment without manual intervention
- 🎯 **Production-Ready Workflows** - Real-world patterns from GitHub issues and release notes
- 🤝 **Reproducible Science** - Standardized, documented experimentation protocols

## 📚 Available Skills (7/70 roadmap)

**Quality over quantity**: Each skill provides comprehensive, expert-level guidance with real code examples, troubleshooting guides, and production-ready workflows.
